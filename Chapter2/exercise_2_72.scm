; The order of growth for the most frequent element is O(n) as we need O(n) for 
; searching through the list.
;
; But for the least frequent element the order of growth is O(n^2) 
; as for the first time we have to search through n element, then through 
; (n-1) elements, then through (n-2) and so on.
; So the order of growth is O(n^2)
